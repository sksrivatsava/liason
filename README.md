# liason
This project, Liaison is an end-to-end Django Web Application based social media platform ( with greater emphasis on the backend and its operations ) which primarily serves the purpose of connecting instructors, students and other staff of the college to exchange posts, as a simpler interface to ensure the easiest possible exchange of notifications and important information. It does work completely on the Instagram model - students follow faculty, and receive notifications of posts ( which can be images, such as circulars, or text, such as instructions on assignments ) of only the faculty they follow.

The project also includes features like searching for faculty or students to follow on the basis of department or designation, posting, getting notified of follow requests, and upvoting posts. All of these operations rely on an SQLite Database which is updated in real-time.
